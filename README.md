# Recipe_website_project
This project showcases the homepage of a recipe website, featuring a navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom.
Below the navigation bar is the main content, which includes images of different types of sweets, along with their ingredients and recipes.
When you hover over the images, a hover effect is applied.
I have also incorporated media queries to ensure that the design is responsive and compatible with various devices.

This is a basic webpage design created using HTML and CSS.
The project demonstrates the use of flexbox, positioning, gradients, borders, box shadows, transforms, and transition properties to create an engaging webpage design.
